# Weather Master

This web app can display your weather status based on your location. It displays your current weather conditions in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. It also provides hourly, daily, and weekly weather forecasts for that location. You can also see the area's wind speed and humidity. All data on the UI is retrieved using the Weather API.
